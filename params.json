{"name":"piccante","tagline":"","body":"piccante\r\n========\r\n``piccante`` is a massively parallel fully-relativistic electromagnetic 3D particle-in-cell code, released by the authors to the whole laser-plasma community under a GPLv3 license.\r\n\r\nIts strengths are related to flexibility: the user is able to define an arbitrary number of particle species with arbitrary density functions and an arbitrary number of Gaussian laser pulses.\r\n\r\nThe code is proved to run on up to 16384 MPI processes. Some preliminary scaling tests verified a very good scalability on up to 4096 MPI tasks.\r\n\r\nIn its present state, the code could be considered in *beta status*.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2014 - Andrea Sgattoni, Luca Fedeli, Stefano Sinigardi\r\n\r\n\r\nA paper that describes the technical features of ``piccante`` is under development now, in the meantime if you want to use the code please ask the authors for a ZENODO doi linked to the release you're using.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Papers containing simulations done with piccante ###\r\n\r\n1) A.
